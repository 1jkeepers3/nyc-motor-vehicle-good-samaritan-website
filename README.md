## I - Introduction

The **NYC Motor Vehicle Good Samaritan Website** is designed to provide an accessible platform for members of the public to share information about motor vehicle crashes with the NYPD, involved parties, and insurance companies.

The goal of this website is to empower New York City residents and visitors to act as "Good Samaritans" by contributing eyewitness information that could assist in crash investigations, insurance claims, or legal proceedings.

New York City's dense population and constant flow of pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers make it a unique environment where many accidents are witnessed but not always reported. This platform bridges that gap—creating a centralized, transparent, and community-driven way for witnesses to share what they saw quickly and securely.

Motor vehicle accidents remain one of the leading causes of premature death in the United States, with thousands of lives lost each year—many of them in urban areas like New York City. By encouraging timely and accurate witness reporting, this initiative aims not only to aid in post-crash accountability but also to promote safer driving behaviors and ultimately make our streets safer for everyone.

Looking ahead, as autonomous vehicles and self-driving taxis become more common on city streets, the platform will also serve as a valuable public resource for monitoring, verifying, and improving the safety and accountability of these emerging transportation technologies.
